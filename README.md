# Med Buddy
A medication app that uses vision and firebase scanning functionality to provide medication information from the barcode provided on the medication bottle


### Description 
Patients often have a difficult time remembering their medications. This presents an issue when they need to provide an accurate medication list for providers. This app will make it easy for patients to keep a living medication list that is easy to formulate and update. Using the OpeFDA API, the app will pull up medications and their usual dosages/indication/route via search or barcode scanning.
